# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 04, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started Learning Web Development with this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). Worked on HTML-Personal Resume. Added home page and contact me page and deployed it on github

**Thoughts:** I've always wanted to be a devloper who can overcome any challenge. Till now I've always struggled with Web Development and thus shifted to android application development for the frontend part of my projects. But recently I had to work on a web app based project, and it seemed to be really fun working with websites and thus I am here. Really looking forward to complete this course and then work on other courses or projects once it's done.

### Day 2: July 05, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added pages for skills and co-curriculars section. Made changes to home page by adding some more info. Completed HTML-Personal CV Project. Started working on CSS-Personal CV Project.

**Thoughts:** Initially, I thought it'd be difficult and not fun at all, but even though the complete website is just plain bland html and no styling at all, finishing my first very own web development project gave me a sense of fullfillment. Now that I'm taking lessons for CSS, will try to implement a better looking HTML+CSS-Personal CV.

### Day 3: July 06, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the styling for Home page of personal website. Currently followed the basic tutorial in the course lecture. Now planning to add more pages to the site.

**Thoughts:** It was a nice experience to turn a bland html code to styled website. I have followed the tutorials till now for it, but will try to improve and change it according to my own from now on. Will spend a few more days on the project before moving onto the next section.

### Day 4: July 07, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started adding new features to the css-personal-cv project. Added Side Nav Drawer and styled it with some little animation. Was stuck with being able to close the nav drawer by clicking anywhere on the page, but in the end had to use minimal javascript to fix that issue. Also added navigation to contact me section. Will start working on Extras, Education and Work Section from tomorrow onwards.

**Thoughts:** Finally started adding my own touches to the website. A minimalistic site like this required a navigation tool, but a bar seemed sort of out of theme, thus I moved forward with Side Nav Drawer. Got stuck at some places, but now I've started to get how styling and positioning works in html and css. Looking forward to improve my knowledge horizons.

### Day 5: July 08, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added Experience Page to the website and started working on education page. Started using reusable components and style to reduce code redundancy across webpages. Basic setup for educations page is done.

**Thoughts:** Added another detail to the website. Started to use reusable components and styles instead of writing redundant code again and again. Had quite a difficulty imagining how UI for other pages should look like, gladly so many developers and designers out there are giving inspiration. Also started to work on a Full Stack AI project with Website dashboard. So I'm implementing bootstrap side by side on it.

### Day 6: July 09, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added Cards with animation for education section for each school I attended. Also added extra courses in the same educations page to finish it off.

**Thoughts:** Had trouble finding time for working on the project given my office timings and other courses. Have decided to wake up earlier from tomorrow to give time to this challenge in the morning as well. Hoping, I'd succeed. Btw, in terms of programming, I tried using codeply to prototype my flip-cards. Also, had some trouble implementing media queries for page responsiveness.

### Day 7: July 10, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added Extras page and fixed issues in the Educations page alignment. Finally completed my CSS-Personal Site Project. For extras section, I used card-based badges to display each skill and concept. Hosted the site on github-pages

**Thoughts:** Finaly Done with css-personal-site project. There were more things which I wanted to add such as carousel, gallery, etc. but I think using bootstrap would be better for those and that'd come up in my upcoming project. For the time being I'll use this simple site as my personal website, but it still lacks a lot and once I'm done with some knowledge of bootstrap and js. I'll create a personalized version of website soon enough. I guess I've spent enough time on CSS and now I'll move ahead to Bootstrap.

### Day 8: July 11, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started with new project - tindog. Implemented styling using css and bootstrap. Done with title section and features section.

**Thoughts:** A new project. Hoping to learn new skills so as to improve my web development experience. After using bootstrap I found how much work can be decreased and made easier by importing this library. Looking forward to learn it effectively as I have a feeling that it'll be an important asset. Also I studied about CSS-Flexboxing apart from the course syllabus to improve my horizons.

### Day 9: July 12, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Styled other sections such as testimonials, pricing and footer for tindog project. Worked on Code Refactoring and Selector Combination+Selector Hierarchies and also Media Queries. Completed the project and also did a better documentation with images on github.

**Thoughts:** Learning Bootstrap is indeed one of the biggest prowess a web developer can have. It was great to work with bootstrap to see how much my code is reduced from a big css mess. Was able to learn how to refactor code and use better programming concepts and how to convert WET code to DRY code. Now moving onwards to JS secton!

### Day 10: July 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed minor image viewing issues on tindog-website. Hosted the site on github pages. Started with Javascript-ES6. Completed the Introduction module and practiced js by working on challenges in the course. Worked on 3 challenges for mathematical operations, functions, logics, and argument/returns in function.

**Thoughts:** It was good. Just like python, JS is a simple language to learn and easy to understand. My previous programming experience in multiple languages allowed me to easily grasp various principles and I was able to understand the JS syntax quickly. Introduction module with challenges are complete and now moving onwards to more complex JS work.

### Day 11: July 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started with 10 days of JS challenge on HackerRank. Done with Day 0, Day 1 and Day 2. Completed modules for console logging, data types, arrays, conditional statements, exception handelling, loops. Also tried the HackerRank Python (Basic) certification challenge and was able to successfully complete it.

**Thoughts:** As, I said before JS has similar code structure as python so it's easier and quicker for me to learn. While working on the 10 days of JS challenge, I found that it's not very difficult to master, though it's been long since I used switch-cases (no switch-case in python), so it took me a while to solve it. Also, been so long since I coded in python and yet I was able to complete it's certification test successfully, it felt really good. I'll still use python as my first language followed by JS for sure!

### Day 12: July 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with javascript practicing. Today I solved challenges for 99 bottles song lyrics using loops and conditional statement and a fibonacci sequence challenge. Apart from that also continued with 10 days of JS. Done with Day 4 and started with Day 5, unknowingly hit a problem of Regular Expressions on Day 8 and was able to solve it after trying a number of times. 

**Thoughts:** It is getting tougher to keep this daily coding habit going on due to my long office hours, but I'm glad that I'm able to commit atleast once per day. The challenges seem good till now and I hope I'll be done with JS soon and start working on websites with JS.

### Day 13: July 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Continued practicing JavaScript. Was able to complete challenges for Day 6 and 7 for 10 Days of JavaScript Challenge and unlocked 4 stars. Apart from that practiced Basic DOM on W3Schools.

**Thoughts:** I can see myself improving in JS day by day. It's really unbelievable for me on how I was able to learn web development so soon that a project I got at office which had UI as a website and it was accepted with no changes by my seniors.
