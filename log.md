# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 04, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started Learning Web Development with this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). Worked on HTML-Personal Resume. Added home page and contact me page and deployed it on github

**Thoughts:** I've always wanted to be a devloper who can overcome any challenge. Till now I've always struggled with Web Development and thus shifted to android application development for the frontend part of my projects. But recently I had to work on a web app based project, and it seemed to be really fun working with websites and thus I am here. Really looking forward to complete this course and then work on other courses or projects once it's done.

### Day 2: July 05, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added pages for skills and co-curriculars section. Made changes to home page by adding some more info. Completed HTML-Personal CV Project. Started working on CSS-Personal CV Project.

**Thoughts:** Initially, I thought it'd be difficult and not fun at all, but even though the complete website is just plain bland html and no styling at all, finishing my first very own web development project gave me a sense of fullfillment. Now that I'm taking lessons for CSS, will try to implement a better looking HTML+CSS-Personal CV.

### Day 3: July 06, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the styling for Home page of personal website. Currently followed the basic tutorial in the course lecture. Now planning to add more pages to the site.

**Thoughts:** It was a nice experience to turn a bland html code to styled website. I have followed the tutorials till now for it, but will try to improve and change it according to my own from now on. Will spend a few more days on the project before moving onto the next section.

### Day 4: July 07, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started adding new features to the css-personal-cv project. Added Side Nav Drawer and styled it with some little animation. Was stuck with being able to close the nav drawer by clicking anywhere on the page, but in the end had to use minimal javascript to fix that issue. Also added navigation to contact me section. Will start working on Extras, Education and Work Section from tomorrow onwards.

**Thoughts:** Finally started adding my own touches to the website. A minimalistic site like this required a navigation tool, but a bar seemed sort of out of theme, thus I moved forward with Side Nav Drawer. Got stuck at some places, but now I've started to get how styling and positioning works in html and css. Looking forward to improve my knowledge horizons.

### Day 5: July 08, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added Experience Page to the website and started working on education page. Started using reusable components and style to reduce code redundancy across webpages. Basic setup for educations page is done.

**Thoughts:** Added another detail to the website. Started to use reusable components and styles instead of writing redundant code again and again. Had quite a difficulty imagining how UI for other pages should look like, gladly so many developers and designers out there are giving inspiration. Also started to work on a Full Stack AI project with Website dashboard. So I'm implementing bootstrap side by side on it.

### Day 6: July 09, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added Cards with animation for education section for each school I attended. Also added extra courses in the same educations page to finish it off.

**Thoughts:** Had trouble finding time for working on the project given my office timings and other courses. Have decided to wake up earlier from tomorrow to give time to this challenge in the morning as well. Hoping, I'd succeed. Btw, in terms of programming, I tried using codeply to prototype my flip-cards. Also, had some trouble implementing media queries for page responsiveness.
