# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 04, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started Learning Web Development with this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). Worked on HTML-Personal Resume. Added home page and contact me page and deployed it on github

**Thoughts:** I've always wanted to be a devloper who can overcome any challenge. Till now I've always struggled with Web Development and thus shifted to android application development for the frontend part of my projects. But recently I had to work on a web app based project, and it seemed to be really fun working with websites and thus I am here. Really looking forward to complete this course and then work on other courses or projects once it's done.
