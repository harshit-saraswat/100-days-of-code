# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 04, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started Learning Web Development with this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). Worked on HTML-Personal Resume. Added home page and contact me page and deployed it on github

**Thoughts:** I've always wanted to be a devloper who can overcome any challenge. Till now I've always struggled with Web Development and thus shifted to android application development for the frontend part of my projects. But recently I had to work on a web app based project, and it seemed to be really fun working with websites and thus I am here. Really looking forward to complete this course and then work on other courses or projects once it's done.

### Day 2: July 05, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Added pages for skills and co-curriculars section. Made changes to home page by adding some more info. Completed HTML-Personal CV Project. Started working on CSS-Personal CV Project.

**Thoughts:** Initially, I thought it'd be difficult and not fun at all, but even though the complete website is just plain bland html and no styling at all, finishing my first very own web development project gave me a sense of fullfillment. Now that I'm taking lessons for CSS, will try to implement a better looking HTML+CSS-Personal CV.
