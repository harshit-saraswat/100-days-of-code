The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 4, Saturday, 2020].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started learning Web Development and started with my first project: HTML-Personal Resume Website. Worked on the basic HTML tags and layouts and setup building blocks of the project.

### R1D2
Continued working on html-personal-cv and finished it. Now Started to work on CSS-personal-cv project. Will aim to make a simplistic yet styled website.

### R1D3
Continued working on css-personal-cv and finished the styling as per the course. Now will add new pages for each skill-set to show my work. The styling process seemed to be more interesting than I thought it to be.

### R1D4
Started adding personal touches and additions. Added a side nav drawer with minimal animation. Got stuck at a few places but fixed it after a little googling.

### R1D5
Added Experience page and started working on educations page. Basic page setup and nav-bar/footer are done on educations page. Learned to use reusable styles and components instead of using same code again and again every-where.

### R1D6
Added Cards for each school in educations page and added flip-animation to it. Used Codeply for prototyping and mediaqueries for page responsiveness. Though had some trouble with those.

### R1D7
7 days completed, ie, my first week done for this challenge. I just finished my css-personal-cv project by adding the final extras page and hosted it on github pages.

### R1D8
Started working on a new project-tindog (a startup landing page site). Here I am learning and implementing styling using Bootstrap. Today completed the title section and features section. Also studied about CSS-Flexboxing to improve my css styling horizons.

### R1D9
Styled other sections such as testimonials, pricing and footer for tindog project. Worked on Code Refactoring and Selector Combination+Selector Hierarchies and also Media Queries. Completed the project and also did a better documentation with images on github.
